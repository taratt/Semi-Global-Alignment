# Semi-Global-Alignment
This project is an implementation of semi-global alignment for proteins using dynamic programming. In this implementation PAM250 matrix is used tto score matches and mismatches and gap penalty is considered to be 9.
## Input
The input to this code is two strings representing two molecules of protein that are going to be semi-globally aligned to one another.
Example:
```
AAAAA
AA
```
